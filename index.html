        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Im currently a 1st year student in the University of Limerick studying Computer Science, with hopes to move

        <h2>My Development Diary</h2>
        <h4>For my module CS4043, me and a team of 6 others are required to create <br>
            a game. As part of this game, we are to log our progress through a dev diary.
            My role for our game is Sound Production.
            </h4>


        <div class="project">
            <h3>Week 1</h3>
            <p>Within Week 1, i made sure i found a team that i could group up with.
                Being someone inclined to do Sound Production, this was no issue as everyone was looking
                for someone to do the Sound. 
                Week 1 was perhaps the least busy week, as we were just getting started.
                <br>
                <br>
                A few things i struggled with this week was that i found it hard to get organized with my team in terms of 
                trying to formulate an idea. Everyone was a little bit scattered and confused.
                To fix this issue, we created a server for our team in Discord, which allowed us to organize meet times, and 
                work on ideas when we arent on campus.
                <br>
                <br>
                Once we created this server, we were able to come up with a team name, which is N Games.
                <br>
                <br>
                To further add to our communication, we created a board on KanBanFlow, and we also created a repository on GitHub
                to keep each of our contributions organized.
                This took alot of weight off my shoulders in terms of being organized and made the whole project feel quite a lot
                less stressful.

                Pictured above is our KanBanFlow Board.
                Setting this up as a team proved to be an issue, as it took us all a while to join the correct board. Aswell as that, getting used to the UI was an issue.
                <br>
                However, after a few days of getting used to it, it is now something i have no issue using personally.

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Week 2</h3>
            <p>During Week 2, me and my team began to brainstorm ideas.
                We came up with a few different concepts, consisting of:
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Spirits</b> : A multiplayer half 2d and 3d game, the main idea of the game
                being that once you die, you die for good. 
                A fighting game, where you spawn into a world 
                with a range of abilites and powers with stats
                 you cannot change but you can improve.
                  The fighting is skill based.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Rob's Servant</b> : With the core theme being a Suspicious Mansion, you are Rob's personal servant and your goal
                is to observe small changes in the mansion that could indicate danger to Rob.
                <br>

                Once again, during this week, not much was done, just brainstorming and thinking as a team.
                As my role is in Sound Production, i am planning on waiting until we have established a particular art style and theme
                before i begin the production.
                <br>
                <br>
                However, this week i did find it difficult communicating with my team. As everyone is doing their own thing, not much
                communication is being passed on. Im sure this will improve during oncoming weeks as we will implement different apps that allow
                us to assign tasks and communicate effectively.
                I thought by implementing Discord and KanBanFlow it would improve our communication , however, it hasnt really done much.

                This week, in terms of skills learnt, i began learning how to use Githubs repository commit system so that we
                could organize our code and other files for our game. Learning this wasnt difficult as there are only a few things to know.

            <div class="project">
                <h3>Week 3</h3>
                <p>
                    During Week 3, all the teams are now fully formed and ideas are beginning to be fleshed out. We have finally decided on our game idea: <b>Rob's Servant</b>.

                    Whilst we havent really made anything yet, we are just mocking up what we want to see from our game, and the requirements we need to stick by.
                </p>
                <p>The layout of our game is:</p>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Gameplay</th>
                        <th>Tone and Style</th>
                        <th>Development Vision</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>The main features of the game will be:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Exploration and Observation</li>
                                <li>Protecting Rob (your boss)</li>
                                <li>Progression</li>
                            </ul>
                        </td>
                        <td>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Slightly eerie, but not horror</li>
                                <li>Victorian/Posh mansion aesthetic</li>
                                <li>A mix of mystery and humour</li>
                            </ul>
                        </td>
                        <td>
                            To keep our game simple for development we will:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Use simple environmental changes</li>
                                <li>Limit movement if needed (fixed camera angles)</li>
                                <li>Build a few core mechanics first, then expand.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </td>
                    </tr>


                </table>

                <p>
                    We met up this week to work on these ideas in our lab class, and one major issue i saw again was lack of communication and
                    organisation.
                    Everyone seems to be in their own little world it seems with our project, and hopefully overtime this improves.
                    

                    This week, i also learnt about the importance of team synergy. For a game or group project to flourish everyone needs to communicate 
                    about their piece of work they have been assigned to ensure the final product has no issues.

                    A skill i learnt this week was definitely thinking of game features, as whilst we brainstormed our game, we all sat back and tried to come up 
                    with different features that could make our game interesting and also add to our theme.

                <h3>Week 4</h3>
                <p>
                    In week 4, i began creating the music we will be using in our game. 
                    The first composition i created was for the menu music. Considering the 
                    game is meant to have an eerie and suspensful theme, i made sure to use 
                    instruments such as creepy synths, violins and strings that instilled that feeling.
                 
                    <br>
                    You can listen to the first composition i created below.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    Whilst creating the piece, i found it difficult to find the sounds that captured the feeling i wanted, and i spent hours searching for them.
                    Once i found the sounds, it wasnt hard composing it, as i had the idea for it in my head.
                    Apart from the instruments, i added effects to them such as reverb and delay to create space in the sound, and to add to the "eerieness".
                    I also added EQ to each sound to make sure there were no harsh frequencies, piercing the players ears.
                    Once i finished the melody, i sent it off to my teammates to implement into the menu.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Upon reflection, i wouldve made the melody more seamless in terms of how it loops as it ends quite abruptly and doesnt exactly loop very cleanly into 
                    the start of the melody.
                    I wouldve also probably made it a bit longer, as its quite short and i feel like if it went on for longer my first issue wouldnt be as noticeable.
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    My team this week also began to work on the game itself, and we have started to implement the menu into the game. 
                    Other members of my team are currently working on the story and characters involved in the game, to make sure they are developed fully within the game.

                <h3>Week 5</h3>
                <p>
                   For week 5, continuing working on the menu i began to search for sound effects we could use for the buttons.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    However before creating these buttons i first wanted to try different versions of the Menu Music melody i created
                    i.e implement different instruments.
                    I worked on this for a solid 30 minutes, but my team had told me that the original was better everytime, so i just left it at that!
                    <br>
                    <br>

                   Anyway, Whilst searching for sounds i could use to create the buttons, i found it difficult to find the right one, so i decided to create my own using sound synthesis.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   To create it, i started with a simple sine wave.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   <img src="Sine_Wave.png">
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   This is the foundation to the sound. Next, i created an envelope for it, to make it more of a "plucky" sound.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   <img src="Envelope.png">
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   Finally, i added some very very suttle effects, such as a compressor to ensure the sound didnt go over a certain 
                   volume threshold, and a tiny bit of reverb to create a tiny bit of room behind the sound.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   <audio controls>

                    <source src="sfx click 1 low.wav" type="audio/mpeg">

                  </audio>
                  
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  I also created a higher variation for other buttons.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <audio controls>
                    <source src="sfx click 2 high.wav" type="audio/mpeg">
                    </audio>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Some challenges i faced whilst creating these sounds is that i found it hard to think about what i wanted for the sound.
                    To over come this i based it off other games' menus, such as minecraft, which uses a more airy rim sound.
                    Using this as influence, it became much easier to think about what i wanted for the game.
                    <br>
                    Looking back on the process of how i created the sound, i also feel as if i had implemented an lfo (low frequency oscillator) it could have made the sound more interesting,
                    however, keeping it simple was what my team had instructed me to do. 
                    <br>
                    In terms of my teams overall progress with the development of the game, they are nearly finished with the main menu. I feel as if there is a big lack of communication
                    between me and my team, but nonetheless they are working on their own jobs and are most likely busy.

                <h3>Week 6</h3>
                <p>
                    During week 6, i spent most of my team just helping our team implement the music i had made into the game.
                    This was confusing for me at first, as i dont really have much knowledge of using C++, however, i found out that i didnt even have to code the music in manually,
                    instead, you just select an audio source. This alleviate alot of stress as i was always wondering how i would do this for the future features i create for the game.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    The menu of our game currently looks like this:
                    <iframe width="800" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_2rdAcscv00"> </iframe>
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   We still havent implemented the sound effects to our menu, however that should happen over the coming weeks.
                    There are a few things i would personally change about the menu, example change the font and the shape of the buttons
                    to give it more of a vintage, victorian look, rather than some type of mobile game, however, i am not in charge of changing that.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   One major issue i am still having is the communication aspect of our team. We dont really talk to each other, hence its hard to get a grasp 
                   of where everyone is at with their bit. Im beginning to have doubts in some of our team members, as i have heard absolutely 0 from them.
                   Nonetheless, the menu was completed which is great progress, so id say we will get on just fine. They did a very good job.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   A skill i learnt this week was how to implement music into unity. This proved to be really easy after a bit of research, and has now provided me with
                   alot of hope regarding what i can do with this game, from a sound and music aspect.

                    This week i wanted to implement more music for the game, specifically something to play in the background and have on repeat. My aims for this was
                    to create something suspensful yet mellow and beautiful, as it would be sitting in the background. An important thing i wanted to avoid was any annoying
                    or loud sounds in this melody as if i did implement those features it would distract the user from the game.

                    The first rendition i created is:
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <audio controls>
                        <source src="116bpm robsservant comp.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
                    </audio>

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    I used very simple elements such as pianos to build that beautiful melody but also used strings to create a suspensful feel.
                    I feel like this melody is similar to the menu music one, keeping the theme consistent.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    One thing i did struggle with was coming up with the composition for the melodies. I went through several different versions
                    of this melody, and it took me a day or two to perfect it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To create these songs im taking a lot of inspiration from the Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim soundtrack, specifically "Streets of Whiterun":
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <iframe width="800" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_34gUVqLkAo"></iframe>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This song was the main inspiration for the melodies i created and definitely helped me perfect it.
                    Through using this song it definitely improved my composition skills in terms of music. It filled my brains
                    with ideas to build off of for this game.
                    I also feel as if this melody is better than the menu music, outlining my improvement during this semester.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In terms of my teams progress with their jobs it seems to be coming along decently, as they are now working on the mansion of the game, and the main fundamental parts of it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I also recieved some feedback this week from my lecturer regarding my development diary which i have tried my best to implement, specifically
                    the content within the diary being too brief and not enough explanation provided.
                    To solve this, i went back through each entry ive done so far and made sure each one clearly explained what i did, learnt, and what i can improve on.

                <h3>Week 8</h3>
                <p>
                    During week 8, our team continued to work on the individual bits we were assigned to. As im not involved 
                    as much in the actual coding side of things, i spent most of this week making tweaks to the music i had created last week.

                    After some reflection, i realized the melody i created last week ended very abruptly, meaning it wouldnt be able to be repeated smoothly in the background of our game.
                    This would be a simple fix for me, as all i had to do was cut any sort of black space at the end of the pattern of the melody, ensuring it loops back into itself when played.
                    
                    Another tweak i made was that i actually increased the bpm (beats per minute) of the melody. Its not a very noticeable change, but it does make the melody feel a bit more upbeat and lively.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The final version of the melody is: 
                    <audio controls>
                        <source src="122 robsservant comp fixed.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
                    </audio>

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After changing the melody, i sent it off to my team to implement into the game.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    An issue i was having this week was the lack of communication between my team and i. Since about week 5 we havent really
                    been communicating our progress on the game to each other, which leaves me in the dark as to the progress of the game.
                    Despite this, i continue to work on my own bit, and always update my team on what ive completed.
                    <br>
                    However, i do know we are at the stage now where we are stiching assets together and polishing things off, which is great.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I feel like this week my reflective skills have improved, as i feel i wouldnt of noticed the issue about the melody unless i was reflecting on it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I also feel like my communication skills have improved, as i am now able to communicate with my team what i have done and what i need from them, however they still seem to be unresponsive.

                <h3>Week 9</h3>
                <p>
                    During week 9, i spent most of my time working on more sound effects for the game. I wanted to create a sound for footsteps, and also just some ambience that would play in certain areas of the game.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To create the footsteps, i cycled through a few premade samples that i found online, and after i found a good one, i brought it into my DAW and just cleaned it up a little bit
                    with some EQ and compression. I also added a tiny bit of reverb to create a bit of space to our characters walk.
                    The final sound is:
                    <audio controls>
                        <source src="concrete-footsteps-2wav-14794.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
                    </audio>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To create the ambience, i followed a similar process to the footsteps, however i used a few different samples to create a more complex sound.
                    I used samples of wind, samples of rain, samples of machinery such as trains and combined them all together.
                    Each of the samples i EQ'd heavily and took specific frequencies out of them.
                    I made it so each sample filled up a different bit of the frequency spectrum, so that it created an intersting ambience
                    <img src="eqpicture.png" style="width: 400px; height: 200px;">
                    <br>    
                    <br>
                    The final sound is:
                    <audio controls>
                        <source src="eerie-ambience-6836.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
                    </audio> 
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I feel like this week i have improved my sound engineering skills, as i have learnt how to carve out a sound based on their frequencies.
                    I also feel like my sound design skills have improved, as i have learnt how to layer different sounds together to create a more complex sound.

                    <br>
                    The main issue i had this week was that i was struggling to find the right samples to use to create the finals sounds, specifically for the footsteps.
                    Every sample i found was either too loud or too quiet, and it took me a while to find that sweet spot.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I sent off the final sounds to my team to implement into the game.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In terms of game progress, my team has sent me an update, thankfully. Our communication has improved greatly over the past week. The update they provided me with
                    is in video form and features the main charater in our game.

                <h3>Week 10</h3>
                <p>
                    Week 10 was my final week of working on the game, as i hadnt any more work i had to do.
                    The final amount of things i contributed to the game were:
                    <ul>
                        <ol>Menu Music</ol>
                        <ol>Background Music</ol>
                        <ol>Button Click Sound Effects</ol>
                        <ol>Footstep Sound Effects</ol>
                        <ol>Ambient Sound Effects</ol>
                        
                    </ul>

                    Throughout my time working on the game, i have learnt a lot about sound design for games, and how to create a sound that fits the theme of the game.
                    I also feel like my sound engineering skills have improved, as i have learnt how to EQ and compress sounds to make them fit into the game better.
                    I am very happy with the final products of the songs i created, i feel as if they really match the game well and perfectly fit the suspensful and eerie style we were going for.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If i could go back and change anything, i would have liked to implement more songs into the game, as it was very enjoyable creating them.
                    I had an idea for a radio in the game which would play different songs which the user chooses, however we never came around to this feature due to time constraints.
                    I would have also liked to have more variation for the click sound effects, such as clicks for different things such as when the player selects an option within the game, and not just the main menu.
                    If i had more time i wouldve liked to also implement a narration voice, possibly using an AI voice, as i feel this wouldve added to the game, however this feature wasnt my priority.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I have learnt loads whilst working on this game, specifically improving my problem solving and communication skills,
                    as our team was required to communicate with each other to ensure we were all on the same page.
                    I feel as if i communicated my end of the project well, however i found that my team didnt give as much feedback as i would have liked as to what they were working on.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I also feel like my time management skills have improved, as i was able to manage my time well and get all my work done on time.
                    Overall, im very happy with the final product of what i contributed to the game.

                    <br>
                    Overall in terms of the game itself, i really like its idea and the theme of it, however i feel as if our exection of the game was slightly sloppy. However,
                    this is excusable as we are all first years and this is our first time working on a game together.
                    I feel like if we had more time to work on the game, we could have made it a lot better, however i am still happy with the final product.

                    This module has been very enjoyable for me, as i have learnt a lot about sound design within games, and game development in general.
                    I have also made some great friends along the way, and i feel like this module has helped me improve my teamwork skills and communication skills.
