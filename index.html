        <h2>My Development Diary</h2>
        <h4>For my module CS4043, we are required to create <br>
            a "dev" diary, logging our progress with our game.
            My Roles are - Sound Production and Programming.
            </h4>


        <div class="project">
            <h3>Week 1</h3>
            <p>Within Week 1, i made sure i found a team that i could group up with.
                Being someone inclined to do Sound Production, this was no issue as everyone was looking
                for someone to do the Sound. 
                Week 1 was perhaps the least busy week, as we were just getting started.
            </p>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Week 2</h3>
            <p>During Week 2, me and my team began to brainstorm ideas.
                We came up with a few different concepts, consisting of:
                <br>
                <b>Spirits</b> : A multiplayer half 2d and 3d game, the main idea of the game
                being that once you die, you die for good. 
                A fighting game, where you spawn into a world 
                with a range of abilites and powers with stats
                 you cannot change but you can improve.
                  The fighting is skill based.
                <br>
                <b>Rob's Servant</b> : With the core theme being a Suspicious Mansion, you are Rob's personal servant and your goal
                is to observe small changes in the mansion that could indicate danger to Rob.
                <br>

                Once again, during this week, not much was done, just brainstorming and thinking as a team.
                As my role is in Sound Production, i am planning on waiting until we have established a particular art style and theme
                before i begin the production.
                <br>
                However, this week i did find it difficult communicating with my team. As everyone is doing their own thing, not much
                communication is being passed on. Im sure this will improve during oncoming weeks as we will implement different apps that allow
                us to assign tasks and communicate effectively.

                <h3>Week 3</h3>
                <p>
                    During Week 3, all the teams are now fully formed and ideas are beginning to be fleshed out. We have finally decided on our game idea: <b>Rob's Servant</b>.

                    Whilst we havent really made anything yet, we are just mocking up what we want to see from our game, and the requirements we need to stick by.
                </p>
                <p>The layout of our game is:</p>
                <table>

                        <th>Gameplay</th>

                        <th>Development Vision</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>The main features of the game will be:

                                <li>A mix of mystery and humour</li>

                                <li>Use simple environmental changes</li>
                                <li>Limit movement if needed (fixed camera angles)</li>
