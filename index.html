        <p>Im currently a 1st year student in the University of Limerick studying Computer Science, with hopes to move

        <h2>My Development Diary</h2>
        <h4>For my module CS4043, we are required to create <br>
            a "dev" diary, logging our progress with our game.
            My Roles are - Sound Production and Programming.
            </h4>


        <div class="project">
            <h3>Week 1</h3>
            <p>Within Week 1, i made sure i found a team that i could group up with.
                Being someone inclined to do Sound Production, this was no issue as everyone was looking
                for someone to do the Sound. 
                Week 1 was perhaps the least busy week, as we were just getting started.
            </p>
        </div>



        <div class="project">
            <h3>Week 2</h3>
            <p>During Week 2, me and my team began to brainstorm ideas.
                We came up with a few different concepts, consisting of:
                <br>
                <b>Spirits</b> : A multiplayer half 2d and 3d game, the main idea of the game
                being that once you die, you die for good. 
                A fighting game, where you spawn into a world 
                with a range of abilites and powers with stats
                 you cannot change but you can improve.
                  The fighting is skill based.
                <br>
                <b>Rob's Servant</b> : With the core theme being a Suspicious Mansion, you are Rob's personal servant and your goal
                is to observe small changes in the mansion that could indicate danger to Rob.
                <br>

                Once again, during this week, not much was done, just brainstorming and thinking as a team.
                As my role is in Sound Production, i am planning on waiting until we have established a particular art style and theme
                before i begin the production.
                <br>
                However, this week i did find it difficult communicating with my team. As everyone is doing their own thing, not much
                communication is being passed on. Im sure this will improve during oncoming weeks as we will implement different apps that allow
                us to assign tasks and communicate effectively.

                <h3>Week 3</h3>
                <p>
                    During Week 3, all the teams are now fully formed and ideas are beginning to be fleshed out. We have finally decided on our game idea: <b>Rob's Servant</b>.

                    Whilst we havent really made anything yet, we are just mocking up what we want to see from our game, and the requirements we need to stick by.
                </p>
                <p>The layout of our game is:</p>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Gameplay</th>

                        <th>Development Vision</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>The main features of the game will be:

                                <li>Protecting Rob (your boss)</li>

                                <li>Slightly eerie, but not horror</li>
                                <li>Victorian/Posh mansion aesthetic</li>
                                <li>A mix of mystery and humour</li>

                        <td>
                            To keep our game simple for development we will:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Use simple environmental changes</li>
                                <li>Limit movement if needed (fixed camera angles)</li>
                                <li>Build a few core mechanics first, then expand.</li>
                            </ol>

                <h3>Week 4</h3>
                <p>
                    In week 4, i began creating the music we will be using in our game. 
                    The first composition i created was for the menu music. Considering the 
                    game is meant to have an eerie and suspensful theme, i made sure to use 
                    instruments such as creepy synths, violins and strings that instilled that feeling.
                 
                    <br>
                    You can listen to the first composition i created below.

                    <br>
                    Whilst creating the piece, i found it difficult to find the sounds that captured the feeling i wanted, and i spent hours searching for them.
                    Once i found the sounds, it wasnt hard composing it, as i had the idea for it in my head.
                    Apart from the instruments, i added effects to them such as reverb and delay to create space in the sound, and to add to the "eerieness".
                    I also added EQ to each sound to make sure there were no harsh frequencies, piercing the players ears.
                    Once i finished the melody, i sent it off to my teammates to implement into the menu.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Upon reflection, i wouldve made the melody more seamless in terms of how it loops as it ends quite abruptly and doesnt exactly loop very cleanly into 
                    the start of the melody.
                    I wouldve also probably made it a bit longer, as its quite short and i feel like if it went on for longer my first issue wouldnt be as noticeable.

                <h3>Week 5</h3>
                <p>
                   For week 5, continuing working on the menu i began to search for sound effects we could use for the buttons.
                   Whilst searching for sounds i could use, i found it difficult to find the right one, so i decided to create my own using sound synthesis.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   To create it, i started with a simple sine wave.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   <img src="Sine_Wave.png">
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   This is the foundation to the sound. Next, i created an envelope for it, to make it more of a "plucky" sound.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   <img src="Envelope.png">
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   Finally, i added some very very suttle effects, such as a compressor to ensure the sound didnt go over a certain 
                   volume threshold, and a tiny bit of reverb to create a tiny bit of room behind the sound.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   <audio controls>

                    <source src="sfx click 1 low.wav" type="audio/mpeg">

                  </audio>
                  
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  I also created a higher variation for other buttons.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <audio controls>
                    <source src="sfx click 2 high.wav" type="audio/mpeg">
                    </audio>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Some challenges i faced whilst creating these sounds is that i found it hard to think about what i wanted for the sound.
                    To over come this i based it off other games' menus, such as minecraft, which uses a more airy rim sound.
                    Using this as influence, it became much easier to think about what i wanted for the game.
                    <br>
                    Looking back on the process of how i created the sound, i also feel as if i had implemented an lfo (low frequency oscillator) it could have made the sound more interesting,
                    however, keeping it simple was what my team had instructed me to do. 
                    <br>
                    In terms of my teams overall progress with the development of the game, im beginning to have doubts and concerns around whether or not we will complete the game.
                    It feels as if no one is really engaging, and that me and maybe 2 other people are the only people doing their jobs.
                    However, im trying to assume everyone is just so busy with working on the game that they cant engage!
