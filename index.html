        <h2>My Development Diary</h2>
        <h4>For my module CS4043, we are required to create <br>
            a "dev" diary, logging our progress with our game.
            My Role is Sound Production.
            </h4>


        <div class="project">
            <h3>Week 1</h3>
            <p>Within Week 1, i made sure i found a team that i could group up with.
                Being someone inclined to do Sound Production, this was no issue as everyone was looking
                for someone to do the Sound. 
                Week 1 was perhaps the least busy week, as we were just getting started.
                <br>
                <br>
                A few things i struggled with this week was that i found it hard to get organized with my team in terms of 
                trying to formulate an idea. Everyone was a little bit scattered and confused.
                To fix this issue, we created a server for our team in Discord, which allowed us to organize meet times, and 
                work on ideas when we arent on campus.
                <br>
                <br>
                Once we created this server, we were able to come up with a team name, which is N Games.
                <br>
                <br>
                To further add to our communication, we created a board on KanBanFlow, and we also created a repository on GitHub
                to keep each of our contributions organized.
                This took alot of weight off my shoulders in terms of being organized and made the whole project feel quite a lot
                less stressful.

                Pictured above is our KanBanFlow Board.
                Setting this up as a team proved to be an issue, as it took us all a while to join the correct board. Aswell as that, getting used to the UI was an issue.
                <br>
                However, after a few days of getting used to it, it is now something i have no issue using personally.

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Week 2</h3>
            <p>During Week 2, me and my team began to brainstorm ideas.
                We came up with a few different concepts, consisting of:
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Spirits</b> : A multiplayer half 2d and 3d game, the main idea of the game
                being that once you die, you die for good. 
                A fighting game, where you spawn into a world 
                with a range of abilites and powers with stats
                 you cannot change but you can improve.
                  The fighting is skill based.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Rob's Servant</b> : With the core theme being a Suspicious Mansion, you are Rob's personal servant and your goal
                is to observe small changes in the mansion that could indicate danger to Rob.
                <br>

                Once again, during this week, not much was done, just brainstorming and thinking as a team.
                As my role is in Sound Production, i am planning on waiting until we have established a particular art style and theme
                before i begin the production.
                <br>
                <br>
                However, this week i did find it difficult communicating with my team. As everyone is doing their own thing, not much
                communication is being passed on. Im sure this will improve during oncoming weeks as we will implement different apps that allow
                us to assign tasks and communicate effectively.
                I thought by implementing Discord and KanBanFlow it would improve our communication , however, it hasnt really done much.

                This week, in terms of skills learnt, i began learning how to use Githubs repository commit system so that we
                could organize our code and other files for our game. Learning this wasnt difficult as there are only a few things to know.

                <h3>Week 3</h3>
                <p>
                    During Week 3, all the teams are now fully formed and ideas are beginning to be fleshed out. We have finally decided on our game idea: <b>Rob's Servant</b>.

                    Whilst we havent really made anything yet, we are just mocking up what we want to see from our game, and the requirements we need to stick by.
                </p>
                <p>The layout of our game is:</p>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Gameplay</th>
                        <th>Tone and Style</th>
                        <th>Development Vision</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>The main features of the game will be:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Exploration and Observation</li>
                                <li>Protecting Rob (your boss)</li>
                                <li>Progression</li>
                            </ul>
                        </td>
                        <td>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Slightly eerie, but not horror</li>
                                <li>Victorian/Posh mansion aesthetic</li>
                                <li>A mix of mystery and humour</li>
                            </ul>
                        </td>
                        <td>
                            To keep our game simple for development we will:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Use simple environmental changes</li>
                                <li>Limit movement if needed (fixed camera angles)</li>
                                <li>Build a few core mechanics first, then expand.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </td>
                    </tr>


                </table>

                <p>
                    We met up this week to work on these ideas in our lab class, and one major issue i saw again was lack of communication and
                    organisation.
                    Everyone seems to be in their own little world it seems with our project, and hopefully overtime this improves.
                    

                    This week, i also learnt about the importance of team synergy. For a game or group project to flourish everyone needs to communicate 
                    about their piece of work they have been assigned to ensure the final product has no issues.

                    A skill i learnt this week was definitely thinking of game features, as whilst we brainstormed our game, we all sat back and tried to come up 
                    with different features that could make our game interesting and also add to our theme.

                <h3>Week 4</h3>
                <p>
                    In week 4, i began creating the music we will be using in our game. 
                    The first composition i created was for the menu music. Considering the 
                    game is meant to have an eerie and suspensful theme, i made sure to use 
                    instruments such as creepy synths, violins and strings that instilled that feeling.
                 
                    <br>
                    You can listen to the first composition i created below.
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    Whilst creating the piece, i found it difficult to find the sounds that captured the feeling i wanted, and i spent hours searching for them.
                    Once i found the sounds, it wasnt hard composing it, as i had the idea for it in my head.
                    Apart from the instruments, i added effects to them such as reverb and delay to create space in the sound, and to add to the "eerieness".
                    I also added EQ to each sound to make sure there were no harsh frequencies, piercing the players ears.
                    Once i finished the melody, i sent it off to my teammates to implement into the menu.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Upon reflection, i wouldve made the melody more seamless in terms of how it loops as it ends quite abruptly and doesnt exactly loop very cleanly into 
                    the start of the melody.
                    I wouldve also probably made it a bit longer, as its quite short and i feel like if it went on for longer my first issue wouldnt be as noticeable.
                    <br>

                <h3>Week 5</h3>
                <p>
                   For week 5, continuing working on the menu i began to search for sound effects we could use for the buttons.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    However before creating these buttons i first wanted to try different versions of the Menu Music melody i created
                    i.e implement different instruments.
                    I worked on this for a solid 30 minutes, but my team had told me that the original was better everytime, so i just left it at that!
                    <br>
                    <br>

                   Anyway, Whilst searching for sounds i could use to create the buttons, i found it difficult to find the right one, so i decided to create my own using sound synthesis.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   To create it, i started with a simple sine wave.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   <img src="Sine_Wave.png">
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   This is the foundation to the sound. Next, i created an envelope for it, to make it more of a "plucky" sound.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   <img src="Envelope.png">
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   Finally, i added some very very suttle effects, such as a compressor to ensure the sound didnt go over a certain 
                   volume threshold, and a tiny bit of reverb to create a tiny bit of room behind the sound.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   <audio controls>

                    <source src="sfx click 1 low.wav" type="audio/mpeg">

                  </audio>
                  
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  I also created a higher variation for other buttons.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <audio controls>
                    <source src="sfx click 2 high.wav" type="audio/mpeg">
                    </audio>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Some challenges i faced whilst creating these sounds is that i found it hard to think about what i wanted for the sound.
                    To over come this i based it off other games' menus, such as minecraft, which uses a more airy rim sound.
                    Using this as influence, it became much easier to think about what i wanted for the game.
                    <br>
                    Looking back on the process of how i created the sound, i also feel as if i had implemented an lfo (low frequency oscillator) it could have made the sound more interesting,
                    however, keeping it simple was what my team had instructed me to do. 
                    <br>
                    In terms of my teams overall progress with the development of the game, im beginning to have doubts and concerns around whether or not we will complete the game.
                    It feels as if no one is really engaging, and that me and maybe 2 other people are the only people doing their jobs.
                    However, im trying to assume everyone is just so busy with working on the game that they cant engage!

                <h3>Week 6</h3>
                <p>
                    During week 6, i spent most of my team just helping our team implement the music i had made into the game.
                    This was confusing for me at first, as i dont really have much knowledge of using C++, however, i found out that i didnt even have to code the music in manually,
                    instead, you just select an audio source. This alleviate alot of stress as i was always wondering how i would do this for the future features i create for the game.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    The menu of our game currently looks like this:
                    <iframe width="800" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_2rdAcscv00"> </iframe>
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   We still havent implemented the sound effects to our menu, however that should happen over the coming weeks.
                    There are a few things i would personally change about the menu, example change the font and the shape of the buttons
                    to give it more of a vintage, victorian look, rather than some type of mobile game, however, i am not in charge of changing that.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   One major issue i am still having is the communication aspect of our team. We dont really talk to each other, hence its hard to get a grasp 
                   of where everyone is at with their bit. Im beginning to have doubts in some of our team members, as i have heard absolutely 0 from them.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   A skill i learnt this week was how to implement music into unity. This proved to be really easy after a bit of research, and has now provided me with
                   alot of hope regarding what i can do with this game, from a sound and music aspect.

                <h3>Week 7</h3>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This week i wanted to implement more music for the game, specifically something to play in the background and have on repeat. My aims for this was
                    to create something suspensful yet mellow and beautiful, as it would be sitting in the background. An important thing i wanted to avoid was any annoying
                    or loud sounds in this melody as if i did implement those features it would distract the user from the game.

                    The first rendition i created is:
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <audio controls>
                        <source src="116bpm robsservant comp.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
                    </audio>

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    I used very simple elements such as pianos to build that beautiful melody but also used strings to create a suspensful feel.
                    I feel like this melody is similar to the menu music one, keeping the theme consistent.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    One thing i did struggle with was coming up with the composition for the melodies. I went through several different versions
                    of this melody, and it took me a day or two to perfect it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To create these songs im taking a lot of inspiration from the Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim soundtrack, specifically "Streets of Whiterun":
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <iframe width="800" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_34gUVqLkAo"></iframe>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This song was the main inspiration for the melodies i created and definitely helped me perfect it.
                    Through using this song it definitely improved my composition skills in terms of music. It filled my brains
                    with ideas to build off of for this game.
                    I also feel as if this melody is better than the menu music, outlining my improvement during this semester.
                
                    I also recieved some feedback this week from my lecturer regarding my development diary which i have tried my best to implement, specifically
                    the content within the diary being too brief and not enough explanation provided.
                    To solve this, i went back through each entry ive done so far and made sure each one clearly explained what i did, learnt, and what i can improve on.
